Acknowledged. This is a full-stack backend-only project focused on building a working RESTful API with Express and Mongoose, structured for Insomnia testing. Our priorities are full-file code, schema accuracy, fast routing scaffolds, and synced models. We’ll start with the minimal viable project structure, using default timestamps and formatting where needed.

We’ll begin by setting up your basic project skeleton: folders, base files, and initial Express + MongoDB config.

First step: Project structure and basic server.
