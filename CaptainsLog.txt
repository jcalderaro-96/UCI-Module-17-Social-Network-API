# ⚓ Captain’s Log — Project Voyage Tracker 🏴‍☠️

/---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Welcome aboard, matey! 🏴‍☠️  
 
This be the **Captain’s Log**, a trusty record of our coding  
voyage through these uncharted digital seas.  

Unlike a public-facing README, this log charts the progress  
of our project’s construction and keeps track of milestones  
reached, code crafted, and battles won. ⚓
  
It serves as our personal chronicle of the workflow, a compass  
to guide future sails, and a tale of collaboration between  
the coder and Chatty, yer loyal AI first mate. 🤖  
 
Whenever ye call “Pause, Captains Log,” we’ll hoist the latest  
updates and plot our course ahead.  
 
So hoist the sails and let’s make this journey legendary! 🚢

/---------------------------------------------------------------------/

This be a backend-focused voyage, buildin’ a RESTful API  
using Express and Mongoose, rigged for Insomnia testing.  

Our prime goals are full-file code, schema accuracy, quick  
routing scaffolds, and synced models. We start with a minimal  
viable project structure, usin’ default timestamps and  
formatting as needed.  

We begin by settin’ up the project skeleton: folders, base files,  
and initial Express + MongoDB configurations.  

First order of business: Project structure and basic server.  

Prepare to create these files and folders:  

📁 config/  
  📄 connection.js  

📁 models/  
  📄 User.js  
  📄 Thought.js  

📁 routes/  
  📁 api/  
    📄 index.js  
    📄 userRoutes.js  
    📄 thoughtRoutes.js  

📄 server.js  

✅ Default is aye — I’ll provide all files now unless ye say otherwise. 

Ready to proceed?
