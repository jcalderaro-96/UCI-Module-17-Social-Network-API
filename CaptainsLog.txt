# ⚓ Captain’s Log — Project Voyage Tracker 🏴‍☠️

/---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Welcome aboard, matey! 🏴‍☠️  
 
This be the **Captain’s Log**, a trusty record of our coding  
voyage through these uncharted digital seas.  

Unlike a public-facing README, this log charts the progress  
of our project’s construction and keeps track of milestones  
reached, code crafted, and battles won. ⚓
  
It serves as our personal chronicle of the workflow, a compass  
to guide future sails, and a tale of collaboration between  
the coder and Chatty, yer loyal AI first mate. 🤖  
 
Whenever ye call “Pause, Captains Log,” we’ll hoist the latest  
updates and plot our course ahead.  
 
So hoist the sails and let’s make this journey legendary! 🚢

/---------------------------------------------------------------------/

This be a backend-focused voyage, buildin’ a RESTful API  
using Express and Mongoose, rigged for Insomnia testing.  

Our prime goals are full-file code, schema accuracy, quick  
routing scaffolds, and synced models. We start with a minimal  
viable project structure, usin’ default timestamps and  
formatting as needed.  

We begin by settin’ up the project skeleton: folders, base files,  
and initial Express + MongoDB configurations.  

First order of business: Project structure and basic server.  

Prepare to create these files and folders:  

📁 config/  
  📄 connection.js  

📁 models/  
  📄 User.js  
  📄 Thought.js  

📁 routes/  
  📁 api/  
    📄 index.js  
    📄 userRoutes.js  
    📄 thoughtRoutes.js  

📄 server.js  

✅ Default is aye — I’ll provide all files now unless ye say otherwise. 

Ready to proceed?

Deliverables: 10%
Your GitHub repository containing your application code.
🟢 Complete. You have a working repo with code and commits.

Walkthrough Video: 37%
A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the social media API must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your README file.
🟡 Not yet submitted. (Assuming you haven’t made the video yet.)

The walkthrough video must show all of the technical acceptance criteria being met.
🟡 Pending video recording. (But your API functionality is getting close.)

The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to start the application's server.
🟢 Ready to show. Server start is simple and tested.

The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for all users and all thoughts being tested in Insomnia.
🟡 Partially ready. Users GET routes are done and tested. Thoughts routes—still working on or testing? 
(If thoughts GET routes are complete, this can be green.)

The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for a single user and a single thought being tested in Insomnia.
🟡 Partially ready. You confirmed GET by ID for users works; for thoughts, depends on your testing.

The walkthrough video must demonstrate POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users and thoughts being tested in Insomnia.
🟡 Partially ready. Users routes mostly done and tested. Thoughts CRUD and reactions still in progress or unconfirmed.

Walkthrough video must demonstrate POST and DELETE routes for a user's friend list being tested in Insomnia.
🟡 Partially ready. Friends add/remove functionality done? If yes, then ready; if not, yellow.

Walkthrough video must demonstrate POST and DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts being tested in Insomnia.
🔴 Not ready. Reaction routes incomplete or untested.

🟡 Unconfirmed. Not marked done, likely not implemented or tested yet.

Summary:

Your backend API is largely functional and the project is well structured with User CRUD mostly complete, 
Thoughts and reactions are in progress but not fully done/tested. 
You’re very close to being ready to record a walkthrough video showcasing all required routes, 
but a few things need finishing before that.

If you want to fast-track the video, focus on finishing Thoughts CRUD and reaction routes next, 
then test friend routes fully.

/---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Current Status — How Far Are We?
User API routes: ✅ Fully done, tested, and stable.

Server startup: ✅ Ready and working.

Repository quality: ✅ All good, clean, and committed well.

User friends add/remove: ✅ Done and tested.

Bonus (delete user’s thoughts on user delete): 🟡 Unconfirmed — likely not fully implemented/tested yet.

Thoughts API routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE): 🟡 Partially done, need final testing and verification.

Reactions routes (POST, DELETE): 🔴 Not done/tested yet.

Walkthrough video link in README: 🟡 Not done until video recorded and uploaded.

What’s Left to Do Before Recording Your Walkthrough Video
1. Finish Thoughts routes fully:
Ensure GET all thoughts works and returns data in Insomnia.

Ensure GET single thought by ID works.

Implement and test POST, PUT, DELETE routes for thoughts fully.

Confirm the logic correctly pushes thought IDs to users when creating thoughts.

2. Complete Reactions routes:
Implement POST reaction to thought.

Implement DELETE reaction from thought.

Test both routes in Insomnia so you can demo them confidently.

3. Confirm Bonus functionality:
Implement and verify that deleting a user also deletes all their associated thoughts.

Test it in Insomnia and confirm it works as expected.

4. Test and finalize Friend routes:
Double-check adding/removing friends routes and make sure they work smoothly.

5. Update README:
Prepare to add the walkthrough video link once recorded.

The Finish Line for Video Recording Readiness
You are at roughly 60-70% complete (User routes done + server ready).
The finish line is at 100% ready-to-record, meaning:

All Thoughts CRUD routes work and are tested.

All Reactions routes work and are tested.

Bonus delete cascade implemented and tested.

Friends routes fully verified.

Insomnia requests ready for a smooth demo.

Your “Race” Analogy
Think of code + API testing completion as building your race car and tuning the engine (~60-70% done).

The walkthrough video recording is driving the race and crossing the finish line.

You can’t submit the race as finished without driving it — but you want to make sure the car is race-ready before you start.

TL;DR — Before You Hit Record
Complete Thoughts routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Complete Reactions routes (POST, DELETE)

Verify Bonus delete behavior

Verify Friends routes fully

Have all routes tested and working in Insomnia

Once that’s done, you’ll be ready to hit record and confidently show everything working in the video.

/---------------------------------------------------------------------/

Estimated Time to Finish Remaining Tasks Before Video Recording
Task	Estimated Time
Complete Thoughts CRUD routes (code + test)	~20 to 30 minutes
Implement & test Reactions routes (POST/DELETE)	~15 to 25 minutes
Verify & test Bonus user delete cascade	~10 to 15 minutes
Double-check Friend add/remove routes	~5 to 10 minutes
Final testing & cleanup in Insomnia	~10 to 15 minutes

Total Estimate:
~60 to 90 minutes to be fully ready to start recording your walkthrough video.
